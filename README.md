# Mars Rover

The aim of the project was to design and build a rover that can be either controlled manually, using a 
website or autonomously, through a self-guiding system (in some ways replicating one of the actual 
Mars rovers). The roverâ€™s task is to navigate its way through an arena and build a map of the different 
objects it encounters. The rover was to be solar-powered, utilising the solar-panels provided. The 
project was split into six different key subsystems, five of which were required to make the rover 
move and detect aliens, buildings, and fans on the arena. The Power Module was to be a separate 
substation used to charge a battery for the rover.  

As a team, we had to design and implement six subsystems to control the rover. These subsystems had 
to effectively communicate with the central controller in order to transmit data collected from the rover 
to the user and control the rover via inputs given by the user.
